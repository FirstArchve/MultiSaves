# MultiSaves

***[Chinese Edition (中文版)](./README.zh.md)***

This is a tool for backing up Minecraft saves.

## 1 Why？

I believe that for most Minecraft players, backing up the saves is a simple matter. But for some people (such as me), this trouble can no longer be troublesome. Due to the particularity of the saves, you may need to back up the mods or the config folder at the same time, or you have installed a map mod and don't want the map array you obtained through exploration to disappear when you restore the backup. Backup saves is sometimes very troublesome, you have to admit it.

## 2 Compile and use

### 2.1 Compile

This program is written in Qt, and the version used for development is Qt5.12.11. No third-party libraries are used in this program.
If you want to compile or develop it, just import the code directly into Qt.

### 2.2 use

This program provides compiled versions of macOS and Windows. Since Qt is cross-platform, it also supports Linux. If you use Linux, I believe you have the ability to compile it yourself (laughs).

Currently the program is only available in Chinese, but with the help of Google Translate, I believe the English version that has been put on the agenda will come soon.

How to use: I think this program is easy to understand, no one does not know how to use it. However, it should be noted that for most Minecraft players, the so-called "core game folder" is the .minecraft folder (called the game directory in the official launcher), but if you enable version isolation, you should Select the version folder of the corresponding version.
